Q.What is the difference between a Database and a Relational Database?
Ans: 
Database or Database Management System(DBMS) and Relational Database Management 
System(DBMS) are both used by SQL to store data and structures. However, each 
type of Database Management System is preferred with respect to different uses. 

The main difference between the two is that DBMS saves your information as files 
whereas RDMS saves your information in tabular form. Also, as the keyword Relational 
implies, RDMS allows different tables to have relationships with one another using 
Primary Keys, Foreign Keys etc. This creates a dynamic chain of hierarchy between 
tables which also offers helpful restriction on the tables.

DBMS sorts out its tables through a hierarchal manner or navigational manner. 
This is useful when it comes to storing data in tables that are independent of one 
another and you don’t wish to change other tables while a table is being filled or edited.

Q. Define SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, DELETE, UPDATE, DROP keywords
Ans: 
1. SELECT keyword is used to highlight and get entries in rows from tables or views. 
It can also be accompanied by AS keyword to provide an alias. To filter the SELECT 
statement, WHERE clause may be included to provide filter conditions and select 
only the wished entries that satisfy the condition.

2. INSERT allows to add or insert a row or multiple rows in a database table. 
Accompanied by VALUES keyword lets you add a row with specific values. 
INSERT may also be accompanied with SELECT to insert the preselected row.

3. CREATE is a keyword used to create elements in SQL. It is usually accompanied 
with the keyword to be created such as CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, etc.

4. DELETE keyword is used to deletes record(s) in a database. You should always use 
it carefully to avoid unwanted data loss. You may delete records you didn’t want to 
delete. Use WHERE clause to specify the range of the records you wish to delete.

5. UPDATE keyword updates or changes the existing data within an existing record. 
Be sure to note that the record must be existent.

6. DROP keyword drops or deletes a table within the database.
