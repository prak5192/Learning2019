Q. What is REST? What is a RESTful Web Service?
Ans: REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is an architectural 
style, which is used to develop services using HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
In REST, Java object state is converted into XML/JSON representation and transfered 
between client and server. Thats why it is called representational state transfer.

Operation:     HTTP Method
============================
C -> Create -> POST
R -> Read   -> GET
U -> Update -> PUT
D -> Delete -> Delete 

Technology used for implementation of REST
1. Jersey
2. Spring implimentation of REST.
===================================================================================

Q. What is the architectural style for creating web API?
Ans: The architechral style of creating web api are:
    -HTTP/HTTPS for client server communication
    -XML/JSON as formating language
    -Simple URI as the adress for services
    -Sateless communication
    
===================================================================================

Q. What tools are used for testing REST webservices?
Ans: 1. SOAPUI 2. PostMan 3. Poster (firefox plugin)

===================================================================================

Q. Mention what are the HTTP methods supported by REST?
Ans: HTTPs method supported by rest are:
1. POST: Its submits information to the server for processing. It should probably 
         returns the modified for new resource.
2. GET: It request a resource at request URL. It should not contain a request body as it will be discarded.
3. PUT: At the request URL, it update the request.
4. DELETE: At request URL, it removes the reaource.
5. OPTIONS: It indicates which techniques are supported.
6. HEAD: About the request URl it returns meta information.

Q. Mention what are resources in a REST architecture?
Ans: 
There are two main building blocks of RESTful Web Services:
1. Resource URIs
2. HTTP Request Methods

===================================================================================

Q.  Mention what is the difference between AJAX and REST?
Ans:
AJAX:
1. In Ajax, the request are sent to the server by using XMLHttpRequest objects. 
The response is used by the JavaScript code to dynamically alter the current page
2. Ajax is a set of technology; it is a technique of dynamically updating parts of UI 
without having to reload the page
3. Ajax eliminates the interaction between the customer and server asynchronously
4. REST requires the interaction between the customer and server

REST:
1. REST have a URL structure and a request/response pattern the revolve around the use of resources
2. REST is a type of software architecture and a method for users to request data or information from servers
3. REST requires the interaction between the customer and server

===================================================================================

Q. Mention some key characteristics of REST?
Ans: Some key characteristics of REST includes
1. REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no state (or session data)
2. With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls as every data is passed to the server
3. Web service mostly uses POST method to make operations, whereas REST uses GET to access resources

===================================================================================
Q. Mention what are the different application integration styles?
Ans: The different integration styles include
1. Shared database
2. Batch file transfer
3. Invoking remote procedure (RPC)
4. Swapping asynchronous messages over a message oriented middle-ware (MOM)

Explain how JAXB related to RESTful web API?
=========================================================
Q. Mention what is the difference between PUT and POST?
Ans: "PUT" puts a file or resource at a particular URI and exactly at that URI. 
If there is already a file or resource at that URI, PUT changes that file or resource. 
If there is no resource or file there, PUT makes one

POST sends data to a particular URI and expects the resource at that URI to deal 
with the request. The web server at this point can decide what to do with the 
data in the context of specified resource

PUT is idempotent meaning, invoking it any number of times will not have 
an impact on resources.

However, POST is not idempotent, meaning if you invoke POST multiple times 
it keeps creating more resources

===================================================================================

Q.  Mention which markup language can be used in restful web api?
Ans: 
1. JSON
2. XML
3. Plain Text
4. HTML

===================================================================================

Q. Mention what is JAX-WS and JAX-RS?
Ans: Both JAX-WS and JAX-RS are libraries (APIs) for doing communication in various ways in Java. 
JAX-WS is a library that can be used to do SOAP communication in JAVA, and 
JAX-RS lets you do the REST communication in JAVA.

===================================================================================

Q. Mention what is the difference between SOAP and REST?
Ans:
SOAP:
1. SOAP is a protocol through which two computer communicates by sharing XML document
2. SOAP permits only XML
3. SOAP based reads cannot be cached
4. SOAP is like custom desktop application, closely connected to the server
5. SOAP is slower than REST

REST:
1. It runs on HTTP but envelopes the message
2. Rest is a service architecture and design for network-based software architectures
3. REST supports many different data formats
4. REST reads can be cached
5. A REST client is more like a browser; it knows how to standardized methods 
and an application has to fit inside it. REST is faster than SOAP
6. It uses the HTTP headers to hold meta information

===================================================================================

Q. What is the Role of HTTP Request Methods in RESTful Web Services?
Ans: HTTP Request Methods play very key role. They inform the server on “What to do with the Client Request”.

===================================================================================

Q. What is the Transport protocol used by RESTful Web Services?
Ans:  HTTP/HTTPS

===================================================================================

Q. How or Why RESTful Web Services are more Reliable and Scalable?
Ans: 
1. because of the defined resources which are the same for every client, caching is made easier. 
After the first request, subsequent requests are served from a memcached instance which 
also scales well horizontally.
2. A part of REST is indeed the URL part (it's the R in REST) but the S is more 
important for scaling: state
3. The server end of REST is stateless, which means that the server doesn't have 
to store anything across requests. This means that there doesn't have to be (much) 
communication between servers, making it horizontally scalable.
4. Of course, there's a small bonus in the R (representational) in that a load
balancer can easily route the request to the right server if you have nice URLs, 
and GET could go to a slave while POSTs go to masters.
5. One thing that REST allows that SOAP doesn't, and that some other answers 
here address, is caching cacheable responses through an HTTP caching proxy or 
at the client side. This may make a REST service somewhat more lightly loaded 
than a SOAP service when a lot of operations' responses are cacheable. All 
this means is that fewer requests end up in your service.
